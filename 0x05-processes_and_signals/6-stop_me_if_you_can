#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A Bash script that stops the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process without using kill or killall.

# Use pkill to send a termination signal to the process based on its command line.
# The -f option matches against the full command line.
# The default signal for pkill is SIGTERM, which gracefully requests termination.
pkill -f "bash ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond"

# You might want to add a check here to see if it actually stopped,
# but for the purpose of the task, the pkill command is the solution.
# For example:
# if pgrep -f "bash ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond" > /dev/null; then
#   echo "Failed to stop 4-to_infinity_and_beyond."
# else
#   echo "4-to_infinity_and_beyond process stopped."
# fi
