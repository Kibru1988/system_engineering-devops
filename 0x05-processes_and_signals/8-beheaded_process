#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A Bash script that forcibly kills the 7-highlander process using SIGKILL (signal 9).

# Use pkill to send SIGKILL (signal 9) to the process based on its command line.
# The -f option matches against the full command line.
# The -9 option specifies the SIGKILL signal.
pkill -9 -f "bash ./7-highlander"

# For local testing, you might want to add a message:
# if ! pgrep -f "bash ./7-highlander" > /dev/null; then
#   echo "7-highlander process forcibly killed."
# else
#   echo "Failed to kill 7-highlander process."
# fi
